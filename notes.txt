# TODO:
# - run process order in a while loop until user signifies they are done / pays
#   - don't send full menu each time, only initial request. With saved context we could
#     just save the menu in saved model state for each context
# - add an extra notes section to each menu item the user requests
# - add a "special instructions" section to the end of the order
# - repeat this all back to the user and ask if it's correct
# - build a function for "is user done with order"
